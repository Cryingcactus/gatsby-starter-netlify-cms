Five years ago, I went on my first big solo trip. I packed a single suitcase and flew from LA to Bali, then spent the summer traveling across Southeast Asia. In many ways, this trip changed my life. I met amazing people, was introduced to new cultures, expanded my horizons… all of the things you expect from a solo trip in unknown lands. This trip was important for another reason too: I saw the impacts of pollution and climate change first-hand.

Don’t get me wrong, I had seen trash on streets before. I’ve always recycled. I knew that waste was bad. But my travels opened my eyes to the reality of it in a way that my bubble couldn’t. I saw people burning trash and beaches filled with litter. I spoke to people about drinking water and the lack thereof. I saw the destruction of towns and villages after a devastating tsunami. This trip popped my safe bubble and woke me up to the urgency of sustainability.

Since then, my interest in social and environmental issues has only grown. I changed my personal buying and consumption behaviors. I stopped eating meat and went (mostly) plant-based. When I worked in consulting, I created a sustainability practice where I worked with companies to define and grow their impact.

And then COVID hit. In a moment the entire world changed. We went into lockdown. It felt like there was death and destruction everywhere. The country called out for change. And my desire to do something more grew.

Fast-forward to today and I’m thrilled to announce the launch of Tgthr, a growth and impact agency for purpose-driven brands. We believe that businesses have the opportunity to lead movements, to be catalysts for social and environmental change. We also believe that profitable growth doesn’t require sacrificing a positive impact. 

There are many amazing brands out there – innovative and exciting brands founded with the goal of adding value to the world. I want to see more brands like this grow. I want to see them become mainstream and found in every retailer. Unfortunately, a lot of these more sustainable products and brands don’t reach that level of growth. There are a lot of reasons for this. Sometimes they simply just don’t find product-market fit. But in many cases, the founders of these companies aren’t traditional founders. They may be women or POC. Or, they may have a non-business background making it difficult for them to navigate the entrepreneurship world. Too often, these founders have trouble accessing the funding or resources they need to accelerate their growth. 

These are the people we want to work with at Tgthr. The overlooked. The bold. The passionate. The people courageous enough to build something that may just change the world.

The time for business as usual is over. At Tgthr, we’re on a mission to build a more just, habitable and equitable world for all. But we can’t do it alone.

Let’s do something great, together.
