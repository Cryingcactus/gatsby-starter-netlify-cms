We all know there is power in storytelling. Good stories have the ability to transport people into another time and place, a different world. It grants people the ability to visualize something that may have once seemed unimaginable. And it gives people a glimpse of the world not how it is, but how it could be. As such, storytelling is particularly important when it comes to driving social and environmental change. Below, we explore some of the key elements needed when sparking change through storytelling.

#### **Educate, empower, and inspire**

Organizations tasked with driving change have different challenges than their conventional counterparts. Whether you’re a not-for-profit trying to raise funds or a consumer company selling more sustainable and ethical products, you have to do more than create desire. Before people are able to take an action towards change, the following things need to happen:

·  Educate: they need to understand the issue and that there is a problem

·  Empower: they need to know that they can make a difference

·  Inspire: they need to know what to do to and be prompted to act

This is where storytelling can be extremely helpful. A good story, whether it’s a video, campaign, blog post, or something else, can accomplish all these things. It can educate people on the issue at hand without making them feel helpless. It can share examples of how change is happening and inspire people to act. And, when done well, it can give people the warm-fuzzies and satisfy the “what’s in it for me” craving that we all have as consumers. 

To create impactful stories that drive change, organizations need to make sure that they’re balancing education, empowerment and inspiration in their stories. If a piece of content is educational but not empowering, your audience may feel discouraged or overwhelmed. If a piece is inspiring but not educational, they may feel like their help isn’t needed. It’s a difficult balance, but when done right can lead to meaningful action. 

#### **Speak to your audience**

Stories should build a bridge between your organization and your audience. To do this effectively, you need to take time to identify and understand your audience. With consumers’ shortening attention spans, stories need to be entertaining and informative. You must research your who you’re trying to reach, figure out what they already know and where they are on their journey, and what drives them to take action. 

Some of this data can come from traditional research and surveys, but don’t be afraid to do some testing. Create a/b tests on small campaigns to figure out which messaging and tone work best. Take a look at your past organic efforts and try to find trends in performance. A data-driven approach to your audience strategy will save you time, effort, and money in the long run.  

#### **Be authentic and transparent**

Like with any marketing, authenticity and transparency are key. Make sure that your story doesn’t come off sales-y. It should speak in a natural and human tone that is true to your brand or organization. The messaging in your story should be consistent with your website, social media, and any other efforts you have. Your story should not feel like a random-one off piece, but like a thoughtful extension of what you’ve already done. 

Be transparent about your role and your relationship with the issues at hand. And be clear about any shortcoming you may have. Storytelling for change should not be used for purpose-washing. A good story creates trust between the audience and your organization, and that requires honesty and transparency. 

#### **Final thoughts**

Storytelling can be extremely powerful. It can act as a driver of change for some of the urgent social and environmental issues our world is facing today. It can put your audience in someone else’s shoes. It can educate, empower, and inspire your audience to take action today. And it should be part of every purpose-driven organization’s strategy.
