Traditionally, our society has always believed that more is more. Brands and businesses have been built around the notion that consumers will always want and buy more. But as concerns around sustainability have grown, a new type of consumer has emerged: the conscious consumer.

A conscious consumer is someone who’s buying practices are driven by their commitment to make a positive environmental and social impact. These individuals try to make more informed decisions about the brands and retailers they shop from. They don’t hesitate to read a company’s about page or analyze a product’s label. They prefer to buy from purpose-driven businesses that share their values. And they embrace the idea of buying less.

This isn’t just a niche group of shoppers. According to a recent [study](https://www.fmi.org/docs/sustainability/BBMG_Conscious_Consumer_White_Paper.pdf), nearly 9/10 Americans say that the term “conscious consumer” describes them well. As brands think about how to resonate with today’s consumers, it’s vital for them to understand what drives this desire for conscious consumption. Today, we’ll explore some of those key drivers.

#### A Desire to Make a Positive Impact

The driving force behind conscious consumerism is the desire to make a positive impact. Today’s consumers are deeply concerned about the health of society and our planet. They want to do their part to make the world a better place. They’re increasingly vocal about this desire. Over the past year, we’ve seen a rise in activism, both online and offline, which reflects the passion and desire for change across the nation.

An element of this activism is to support businesses that align with consumer values and to boycott ones that don’t. Last summer, nearly [40% of Americans](https://www.comparecards.com/blog/38-percent-boycotting-companies-political-pandemic-reasons/) were boycotting at least one company. This number was higher for younger generations with over half of Gen Z and Millennials saying they were participating in a boycott of this kind. Consumers have realized the power of their wallets and are not hesitant to vote with their dollars.

But consumers don’t just want brands to talk about their values. They want them to act on them. 88% of US and UK consumers [stated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/solitairetownsend/2018/11/21/consumers-want-you-to-help-them-make-a-difference/?sh=63bdc1d06954) they would like brands to help them make a difference. They want companies to create products that enable them to live more sustainable, ethical lives. This means things like less packaging waste and transparency in the supply chain.

#### Making Informed Decisions

Conscious consumers aren’t afraid to do their research. They seek natural, organic, and ethical products that meet their needs and align with their values. They look for 3rd party certifications, such as Fair Trade, Leaping Bunny, and B Corp, to make sure that companies practice what they preach.

They value honesty and transparency from companies and are appreciative when brands help them make informed decisions. Even though they are willing to do research to find the information they need, they’re still impatient. If they’re not able to quickly find the information they’re looking for, they won’t hesitate to pick a different brand or product that better aligns with their values.

Having a clear about page and easy to understand product descriptions is crucial when trying to reach conscious consumers. Make sure your about page clearly describes your company’s value and standards. Ensure that product pages include product ingredients and materials and end-of-life instructions. If your products have been certified by any third parties, make sure you include those clearly on your labels and product pages. Don’t hesitate to ask consumers what information is important to them. Then, act on their suggestions to make their decision-making process easier.

#### The Importance of Purpose-Driven

Most brands today state they support social and environmental causes. But conscious consumers are looking for more than that. They see through green, black, and rainbow wash, and won’t hesitate to call out brands that are saying more than they’re doing. Being a purpose-driven company is about more than creating ethical products or sharing a #BLM tweet. It’s about integrating end-to-end social and environmental sustainability into your organization.

This means that you’re not only working with Fair Trade suppliers, but that you’re also actively working to elevate women, people of color, LGBTQ+, and other individuals of underrepresented groups within your organization. When you’re hiring new talent, you’re checking your JDs for inclusive language and participating in inclusive hiring practices. If you’re a smaller company, you’re seeking out diverse opinions and perspectives.

It also means that if you’re making environmental claims or sustainable lifestyle products, that you’re looking inward at your own footprint. How are you handling waste? Are you measuring your carbon footprint? For most companies, it’s hard to address every environmental concern. Consumers don’t expect you to do or fix everything today. But they do want transparency. It's expected that companies have a good understanding of their impacts on the environment and community.

#### Less is More

The most complicated element of conscious consumption is the idea of buying less. If companies offered truly sustainable products, consumers wouldn’t need to buy them more than once. This doesn’t align with traditional business practices. While only a small number of Americans are ready to stop buying things, the less is more principle is important. Consumers are looking to invest in higher quality products that will live beyond one season.

This also applies to how we market sustainable brands. Sustainable marketing includes communicating the importance of reducing overall consumption. For a fashion brand, this may mean creating marketing materials that showcase the quality and versatility of their pieces. For food brands, it could mean addressing food waste. The trend of encouraging people to buy, buy, buy should go out the door when marketing to conscious consumers.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that we are going to cut Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), but we need to look at it in a different way. Sustainable organizations shouldn't encourage consumption for consumption's sake. Conscious consumers don't want to buy just to buy. Brands need to re-evaluate their metrics and identify goals and KPIs that are sustainable for them and the planet. A company can’t do good if they aren’t in a healthy economic position.



Marketing to a conscious consumer is so much more than saying you’re green or using a hashtag. It is building a company that embraces sustainability and is constantly working to be socially and environmentally responsible. And it means being transparent about those efforts and any shortfalls.

At Tgthr, we believe that businesses have the opportunity to create meaningful and lasting change while driving healthy revenues and strong growth. Are you ready? Let’s do something great, together.
